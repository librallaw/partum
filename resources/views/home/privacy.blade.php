                        <p>We use cookies to personalize our Services for you and to collect aggregate information about usage of our Services. A cookie is a text file or other local storage identifier provided by your browser or associated applications. We use cookies for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your use of our Services.

These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you access or use our Services. For example, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns for our Services. Google Analytics generates a cookie to capture information about your use of our Services, which Google uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services. Google may use a portion of your IP address to identify its cookie, but this will not be associated with any other data held by Google. We may also permit third-party service providers to place cookies for our Services, as indicated above, to perform analytic or marketing functions where you are notified of them and you have consented to the usage. We do not control the use of such third-party cookies or the resulting information, and we are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
                        <p>By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the placement of cookies on your Devices as described in this Privacy Policy. If you prefer not to receive cookies through our Services, you may control how your browser responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your web browser. Unless you set your browser settings to refuse all cookies, our system may issue cookies when you access or use our Services. If you set your browser settings to refuse all cookies, the performance of certain features of our Services may be limited or not work at all.</p>
